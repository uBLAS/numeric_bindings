[section hetrs]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `hetrs` available, please see below.
``
hetrs( const MatrixA& a, const VectorIPIV& ipiv, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`hetrs` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines CHETRS and ZHETRS. 
`hetrs` solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
Hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
A = L*D*L**H computed by ZHETRF.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/hetrs.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::hetrs( x, y, z );

``

this will output
